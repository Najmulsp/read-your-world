# Read Your World

## my website link: https://read-your-world.netlify.app/

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- This is a book reading website.
- I have used tailwind css for design my website because tailwind css class is easy to used.
- I have also used daisy ui tailwind css framework because daisy ui components is easy to customize.
- I have used react router for routing my website.
- I have used rechart for showing my page count with book name.
